			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I believe it was Monte Cook who originally wrote this adventure as the shortest, yet technically complete, Dungeons and Dragons adventure, including a hook (there's a pie), a dungeon (a 10' x 10' featureless room), a monster (the orc), and treasure (the pie).  I first read about it in an article written by Will Wheaton about teaching his step-son to play D&amp;D.  Here's my interpretation.
